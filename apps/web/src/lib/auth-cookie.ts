/**
 * httpOnly-cookie refresh transport — web adoption of ADR-0008 (T12.3).
 *
 * The API ships two cookie endpoints (cycle 9):
 *   - `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh-cookie`: rotates the refresh token carried
 *     in the `kh_refresh` HttpOnly cookie and returns the AuthOut triple
 *     (user + fresh pair); the rotated token is ALSO installed as the new
 *     cookie (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax, path=/api/v1/auth).
 *   - `POST /api/v1/auth/logout-cookie`: clears the cookie and revokes the
 *     session it points at (idempotent, always 204).
 *
 * The cookie is HttpOnly — JS can neither read nor write it; it can only ask
 * the browser to SEND it. Both endpoints go through the SAME typed openapi
 * client (`api`) with `credentials: "include"` so the browser attaches
 * `kh_refresh`. The endpoints are registered as PUBLIC_AUTH_PATHS in
 * @poipoihisab/api-client, so the client middleware neither pins a stale Bearer
 * header onto them nor recurses its 401 handling when they answer 401.
 *
 * TRANSPORT-INTERLEAVING GUARD (why the cookie is a fallback, never a peer):
 * the JSON `POST /auth/refresh` rotates the token but does NOT touch the
 * cookie. After any JSON rotation the cookie therefore holds a stale,
 * tombstoned token whose replay trips the server's reuse detection and
 * revokes the WHOLE session family — including a perfectly valid token in
 * localStorage. The cookie transport is consequently probed ONLY where the
 * JSON fallback cannot answer, i.e. when no refresh token is persisted
 * locally (boot restore with cleared storage / private mode) or the server
 * definitively rejected the persisted one (401/403). That gating lives in
 * the package client's `refreshSession` (JSON first, cookie fallback once,
 * single-flight across both); this module is the typed transport + the
 * registration glue (`configureCookieAuth`).
