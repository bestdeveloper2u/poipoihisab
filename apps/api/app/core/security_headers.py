"""Security headers middleware (T19.4, ADR-0018).

Adds `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy:
strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, and `X-Frame-Options: DENY` to every API
response, including 404s and error responses raised before/inside routing
(implemented as a pure ASGI middleware so nothing that sends an
`http.response.start` can bypass it).

Deliberately NOT set here: CSP and Permissions-Policy. Those are edge
concerns owned by the root `vercel.json` (see ADR-0018) — the browser that
needs them talks to the Vercel edge first, and keeping a single source of
truth avoids the two layers drifting apart. Cache-related headers are left
untouched.
